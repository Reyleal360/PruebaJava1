### 2. Mock System Implementation

- ✅ Created `MockReportServiceImpl.java` with realistic test data
- ✅ Eliminated database dependencies for CSV export
- ✅ System generates CSV files with correct format and complete data

### 3. Exhaustive Testing

- ✅ Created unit tests with JUnit 5
- ✅ Tests for logging system (`AppLoggerTest`)
- ✅ Tests for CSV export (`ReportServiceTest`)
- ✅ Specific tests for mock service (`MockReportServiceTest`)
- ✅ Simple verification test executed successfully
